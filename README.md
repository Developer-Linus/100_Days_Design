# 100 Days of Daily Design

## Day One
On this day, I received the prompt `Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.` I picked the design of a sign up for an app that farmers can use to register for a platform they can use to access sustainable farming tips. The link to the design is [signup](https://www.figma.com/design/O0qkG0enQDCPMfke4xMscL/100-Days-of-Design?node-id=4-2&t=FENlGPD70gdSZ130-1). <br>
I challenged myself by doing research and coming up with a design that is simple and clean for farmers to register for the platform. My first day of design started. I will keep this spirit going until I finish 100 designs that I'll document them here. The design for day 1 is a pdf file `day1.pdf`.
## Day 2
On this day, the challenge was designing a checkout page. I took a challenge to design a payment page for a mobile. I researched on the best colors that depict security and trust for the page.
Check on `day2.pdf` for the design. The prompt that guided me is `Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.`

## Day 3 - Landing page
The prompt `What's the main focus? Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a SaaS product? Consider important landing page elements (Headlines, call-to-action buttons, typography, clarity, etc.)`. I researched on the best elements that are essential for landing page. Check `day3.pdf` for the design.
